		<span class="text-blue-200">3LittleBears</span> is a project I cooked up to help get your
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> playlists just right. It works by querying
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> for the genres associated with whatever song you
		happen to be listening to. Then it suggests one of your playlists to place the song into based
		on genre first, and
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> stats like dancability second. It's not feature complete
		yet but will be soon.
