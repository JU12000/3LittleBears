		<span class="text-blue-200">3LittleBears</span> is a project I cooked
		up to help get your
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> playlists just right. It
		works by querying
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> for the genres associated with
		whatever song you happen to be listening to. Then it suggests one of your
		playlists to place the song into. You can also click on any of the genres
		in the list to go to the Every Noise at Once research page for that genre
		and do your own digging.
