		<span class="text-blue-200">3LittleBears</span> is a project I cooked up to help get your
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> playlists just right. It works by querying
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> for the genres associated with whatever song you
		happen to be listening to. Then it suggests one of your playlists to place the song into based
		on genre first, and
		<span class="text-spotify">Spotify</span> stats like dancability second. You can also click on any
		of the genres in the list to go to the Every Noise at Once research page for that genre and do your
		own digging.
